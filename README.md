**Project Title**
LinG3D: Visualizing the Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Clonal Evolution

**Description**
This code generates the 3D lineage trees of (1) all clones; (2) individual clones; (3) all clones , but with only those cells that survived to the end of simulation; and (4) individual clones containing only those cells that survived to the end of simulation. 

**Installing**

R: the required libraries are readr, rapportools, rgl, and devtools. 

        install.packages("readr") # LinG3D built under version 2.1.2

        install.packages("rapportools") # LinG3D built under version 1.1
        
        install.packages("rgl")  # LinG3D built under version 1.3.1

        install.packages("devtools") # LinG3D built under version 2.4.5
   
        library(devtools)  # load the devtools library

        install_github("rejniaklab/r_LinG3D")  # install the package from GitHub

        library(LinG3D)  # load the LinG3D library

        linG3DClone(arguments)  # run the routine (example)
